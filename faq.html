        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <h3>What types of shavings do you offer?</h3>
          <p>We produce premium wood shavings in several varieties: horse stall shavings (dust-free and highly absorbent), small animal bedding, and general-purpose shavings. All are made from clean, kiln-dried lumber.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <h3>How much do shavings cost?</h3>
          <p>Pricing varies based on quantity and delivery requirements. We offer competitive rates with volume discounts for bulk orders. Contact us for current pricing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <h3>How are shavings packaged?</h3>
          <p>Our shavings come in compressed, easy-to-handle bales that expand when opened. This makes them convenient for storage and transport.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <h3>Are your shavings dust-free?</h3>
          <p>Our horse stall shavings are specially processed to minimize dust, making them ideal for horses with respiratory sensitivities. They're also virtually dust-free compared to standard shavings.</p>
